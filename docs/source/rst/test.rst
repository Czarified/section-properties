Testing and Results Validation
===============================

sectionproperties has a (slowly) growing suite of tests. The testing suite
serves to verify functionality and find exceptions from edge cases, but 
also validate the results against known cases. Since this library performs 
engineering calculations, it should have some manner of proving its accuracy. 
Obviously each analyst who uses it is responsible for their own projects 
and calculations, but having a high level of confidence that the software 
can produce *correct* results, *given the correct inputs*, is a boon to all users.
Some test results and explanations from the latter category will be outlined 
on this page, since the former really serves no use to the end user.


Text Book Examples
--------------------
An obvious starting location is replicating examples from academic texts.
"Aircraft Structures" by David J. Peery is a highly regarded text in the 
field of aerospace structures [1]_.
